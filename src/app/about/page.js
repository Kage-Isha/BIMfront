          BIM Student Connect is a platform designed to support students pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Management (BIM).
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 text-center">
          Our goal is to encourage sharing of academic resources through a dedicated <strong>book donation and request system</strong>. Students can easily donate books they no longer use or request the ones they need — promoting a sustainable learning environment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-4 text-center">
          Alongside that, we keep you updated with the <strong>latest news</strong>, allow students to share <strong>academic blogs</strong>, and create a space for <strong>collaboration and community engagement</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg text-center">
          Our platform is built by students, for students — to pass the knowledge, not the dust.
